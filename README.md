# Frankfurter Exchange Rates Viewer

## Description

The **Frankfurter Exchange Rates Viewer** is a React web application that fetches and displays real-time foreign exchange rates using the [Frankfurter API](https://www.frankfurter.app/). The app organizes the exchange rates in a paginated format, allowing users to view data efficiently. It leverages **React Bootstrap** for responsive and clean styling, ensuring a smooth user experience. 

### Key Features:
- Fetches live exchange rates with base currency set to **USD**.
- Displays data in paginated format, improving readability for large datasets.
- Clean and responsive UI powered by **Bootstrap**.
- Loading and error states are gracefully handled.

### Technologies Used:
- **React** for the front-end framework.
- **Axios** for making API requests.
- **React Bootstrap** for responsive styling.
- **Frankfurter API** for currency exchange data.

This project is a demonstration of React's `useEffect` and `useReducer` hooks, focusing on making external API calls and managing state effectively in a paginated format.
